		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			I am a Syrian born in 26/07/2023 who graduted from Monash University
			in 2024 April, my passion (and job) is Computer Science, this 90% of
			the time means Software engineer but I do hope to experince parts
			that have to do less with programming and more with other fields of
			computer science, like Security and Telecommunications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ok, the rest will be quite informal. Writing is not one of my strong
			suites, I am mainly writing this because this is expected of me as a
			profesional developer, but I never was the type to write on social
			media. so this does feel akward to write.
		</p>
		<h1>How I got into programming</h1>
		<p>
			I have been coding somewhat serieously since I was in grade 7 (11
			years old) using Small Basic. I do have some prior experince to that
			where I did some HTML (when I say HTML I mean all 3 of HTML, CSS and
			JavaScript) and Scratch (if that counts as a programming language).
			Scratch was because I wanted to make video games (like most
			children), and HTML was tought to me in a post-school programming
			club that my parents made me go to, I was not that intrested in HTML
			but I did have a lot of fun with Scratch. For Small Basic, that was
			tought in the school's IT class (like, we were examined on it). So I
			did talk it more serieously and this was my first experince with a
			text based procedural language (I did not do much JavaScript and
			Scratch used building blocks).
		</p>
		<p>
			Fast forword to grade 8 where the school was advertising buying
			books from this book store that I do not remember its name (I
			believe they where doing this because they were cutting a small cut
			of the revenu). So my father decided that each one of us (me and my
			siblings), should get a book, I choose <a
				href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781407164984&i=stripbooks&linkCode=qs"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				>Coding Unlocked: Scratch and Python: the basics</a
			>, now this book won't teach you much programming but it did get me
			intrested in the Python programming language. So I did learn it using free
			online resources (mainly youtube).
